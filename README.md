# Cell-Simulator
Simple and clean [Agar.io](https://agar.io/) type game made in [Unity 2D](https://unity.com/) for Android devices. The project was made using Unity version 2021.3.22f.

Note that this was my first "finished" project so the code is pretty bad!

Here's a quick video made demonstrating the the project and most of its features https://youtu.be/kuOGl9nbOqI
